    "### 🔥 Key Takeaways:\n",
    "- **Use Bagging** when your model is **overfitting** and has **high variance** (e.g., Decision Trees).  \n",
    "- **Use Boosting** when your model is **underfitting** and has **high bias** (e.g., Logistic Regression).  \n",
    "- **Use Stacking** when you want to **combine multiple strong models** for better performance.  \n",

    "🚀 Choosing the right technique depends on your dataset, model performance, and specific use case!\n"
