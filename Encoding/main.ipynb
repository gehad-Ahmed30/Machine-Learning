    "### One-Hot Encoding Explanation\n",
    "**One-Hot Encoding** is a technique for converting categorical data into a numerical format that can be used in mathematical models and machine learning. This is done by creating a separate variable for each category in the original column, then assigning a value of **1** to the category that applies to the sample and **0** to the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have a column named **\"City\"** containing the following values:\n",
    "ðŸš© **[\"Cairo\", \"Alex\", \"Giza\"]**  \n",
    "Applying **One-Hot Encoding**, it will be transformed into:\n",
    "\n",
    "| City  | Cairo | Alex | Giza |\n",
    "|-------|------|------|------|\n",
    "| Cairo |  1   |  0   |  0   |\n",
    "| Alex  |  0   |  1   |  0   |\n",
    "| Giza  |  0   |  0   |  1   |\n",

    "- When there is **no natural order** or **mathematical relationship** between categorical values.\n",

    "- When the categorical variable has a **direct relationship with the target variable** (e.g., price, ratings).  \n",

    "- **Example:** Predicting house prices based on neighborhood.  \n",

    "âœ… **Hash Encoding (Feature Hashing):**  \n",
    "- When the number of categories is **extremely large**, making One-Hot Encoding impractical.  \n",
